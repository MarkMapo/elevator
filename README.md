# elevator
This is a simple project to create an elevator program that calculates the time that the elevator moves to one or more floors.

Create the executable...<br>
    <code>make</code>

Run the executable...<br>
    <code>elevator -start=12 -floors=2,9,1,32</code>

The output from the executable will show the amount of time total (for the elevator to travel to all the floors) and the travel time between each floor.  It will also show the floors that were travelled to.<br>
    <code>times=560,100,70,80,310 floors=2,9,1,32</code>
